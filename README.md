## Purpose / Functionality :bulb:

- This is a browser app that can be used to determine Direct Debit processing days for a selected year by accounting for weekends, bank holidays and other non-work days. 
- Companies who operate a Direct Debit scheme will rely on a processing calendar to determine their schedule for specific Direct Debit processes, both internally and in terms of DD claim submission to Bacs. This is to ensure that the agreed withdrawal date, between Service User (company, payee) and the customer, is met. Processing dates for both Service User and bank are determined by working days, and therefore need to be adjusted to account for bank holidays, weekends, and office closures. Determining when these dates are can be a manual, complex and risk-prone process, and so this app was created to meet a real challenge / need for automation.
- There is a [3 day processing cycle](https://www.bacs.co.uk/services/bacs-schemes/getting-started/direct-debit/#:~:text=To%20collect%20Direct%20Debit%20payments,then%20transmitted%20to%20each%20institution.) operated by Bacs.
